# Inventory Application

## About
An inventory web application for getting the hang of Node.js and Express. With CRUD operations for any user to try out. Used MongoDB for the database. Hosted using Railway.

Note that the styling of this application isn't anything special. The focus on this application was to get used to Node and Express. 

## CRUD 
### Creation of items
Can only create objects using objects that already exists. To create Items of a specific Category, that category must already have been created. 

### Deletiong of Items
Objects can only be deleted if it's not referenced by other objects. Categories cannot be deleted before all the Items within that Category has been deleted.
